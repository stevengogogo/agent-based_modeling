Review: keynotes in retrograde response
=======================================

The yeast retrograde response as a model of intracellular signaling of mitochondrial dysfunction
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Abstract

1.  Mitochondrial dysfunction activates intracellular signaling pathways that
    impact yeast longevity.

    1.  The best known one is the retrograde response

    2.  It is also discerned in invertebrates to human cells

    3.  NF$$\kappa$$B is a retrograde response transcription factor.

        1.  discovered not only by functional analysis

        2.  NF$$\kappa$$B can regulate Myc-Max, which is activated in human
            cells with dysfunctional mitochondria and impacts cellular
            metabolism

2.  Myc-Max is homologus to the yeast retrograde response transcription factor
    Rtg1-Rtg3.

### Introduction

1.  Mitochondrial dysfunction

    1.  Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy

    2.  cardiac hypertrophy

    3.  Parkinson's disease

    4.  cancer

    5.  May determine life span

        1.  *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila melanogaster*, mouse, yeast

2.  Identify retrograde response in [bioinformatics
    approach](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2980572/pdf/nihms233811.pdf)

3.  Yeast retrograde response

    1.  $$\text{rho}^0$$ vs. $$\text{rho}^{+}$$

        1.  Lost TCA cycle $$\rightarrow$$ lost glutamate synthesis, due to
            compromised activity of succinate dehydrogenase

        2.  Still poccess first three ractions

            1.  Metabolic adaptation: $$\alpha$$-ketoglutarate $$\rightarrow$$
                glumate. If citrate is provided by the activation of glyoxylate
                cycle

        3.  No active electron transport chain

4.  Retrograde response

    1.  translocation of Rth1/3 heterodimer

        1.  helix-loop-helix/leucine zipper proteins

        2.  bind to the sequence GTCAC (R box)

        3.  Rtg1 is atypical, there is no apparent transcriptional activation
            domains

        4.  **Requires: Rtg2 protein**

            1.  Rtg2 has no known homologs in higher organism

            2.  Rtg2 promotes the dephosphorylation of Rtg3 by binding Mk1 and
                preventing Mk1 from forming a complex with the 14-4-4 protein
                Bmh1 or Bmh2 ([minor
                isoform](https://www.yeastgenome.org/locus/S000002506)), a
                complex which maintain in a hyperphosphorylated state.

            3.  Mks1 is removed by ubiquitin-mediated degradation promoted by
                the ubiquitin ligase component Grr1.

                1.  Grr1 $$\rightarrow$$ positive regulator

                2.  Mks1 $$\rightarrow$$ Negative regulator

            4.  TORC1 negatively regulate both upstream and downstream of Rtg2

                3.  Genetic studies:

                    1.  WD-protein Lst8/ mutation of Lst8

                4.  When glutamate and nutrient are plentiful, TORC1
                    downregulates pathway

                5.  TORC1 \<-\> negative feedback from dysfunctional
                    mitochondria

                    2.  mediate phosphorylation of Sch9 (AGC protein kinase) is
                        downregulated

                    3.  Phosorylated Sch9

                        1.  Antagonize stress responses

            5.  Reactions
